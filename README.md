# Candle Hotspot
This is an addon for the Candle smart home controller. It is designed to allow for easy to use privacy protectionand security for wi-fi devices in smart homes.

It does this by generate a wifi hotspot from your Raspberry Pi, to which you can connect your smart devices. This will have a number of advantages.
- Keep the Wi-Fi devices separate from your home network, so they can't see your phone or laptop. This limits the risk if one of these devices is hacked.
- You can also see which webservers the devices try to connect to. This can be very revealing.
- You can even block those connections with the click of a button. For example, you can allow a smart thermostat to connect to its main server, but not to any additional advertising servers.
